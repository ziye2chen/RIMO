## üìöÔ∏è ReIMO

![](img/math_model_scores.png)

ReIMO (Remade International Mathematical Olympiad) is a purpose-built benchmark for probing large-language-model reasoning at true Olympiad level.

- 335 single-integer problems (ReIMO-Main) ‚Äì each original IMO question is carefully rewritten so its answer is one unique integer, allowing 100 % deterministic grading.

- 472 full-proof problems (ReIMO-Proof) ‚Äì untouched IMO statements paired with vetted reference solutions and an open-source rubric grader for scalable proof assessment.

All 807 tasks are drawn exclusively from IMO contests and shortlists (1959 ‚Äì 2023), covering the four canonical domains‚Äîalgebra, geometry, number theory, combinatorics‚Äîand tagged by year, topic, and source. ReIMO therefore delivers a high-resolution, noise-free yard-stick for evaluating both answer-finding and proof-writing skills in modern LLMs.

## üî• Test Your Model on ReIMO-Main

ReIMO-Main is a set of 335 single-integer problems, each original IMO question is carefully rewritten so its answer is one unique integer, allowing 100 % deterministic grading. For the answer verification, we can directly compare the predicted integer with the correct answer.

### Your Own Model or Open-Source Model

`./code/ReIMO_Main_Open_Source.py` is a sample code for evaluating your own model or open-source model on ReIMO-Main. You can simply replace the `model` variable with your own model for inference.


```bash
cd ./code
python3 ./ReIMO_Main_Open_Source.py
```

### API

We also provide a sample code for evaluating the model with api. You can replace the `model_name` variable with your own model name, `api_key` with your own api key, and `base_url` with the url of the api.

```bash
cd ./code
python3 ./ReIMO_Main_API.py
```

## üß© Test Your Model on ReIMO-Proof

ReIMO-Proof is a set of 472 full-proof problems, untouched IMO statements paired with vetted reference solutions and an open-source rubric grader for scalable proof assessment. For the proof assessment, we can use the provided rubric to grade the proof and provide a score.

### Your Own Model or Open-Source Model

`./code/ReIMO_Proof_Open_Source.py` is a sample code for evaluating your own model or open-source model on ReIMO-Proof. You can simply replace the `model` variable with your own model for inference.


```bash
cd ./code
python3 ./ReIMO_Proof_Open_Source.py
```

### API

We also provide a sample code for evaluating the model with api. You can replace the `model_name` variable with your own model name, `api_key` with your own api key, and `base_url` with the url of the api.
