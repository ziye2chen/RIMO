## üìöÔ∏è RIMO

![](img/math_model_scores.png)

This repository contains two complementary tasks:
- **RIMO‚ÄëN**: single-step math problems scored by a numeric final answer.
- **RIMO‚ÄëP**: multi‚Äëpart proof problems solved step‚Äëby‚Äëstep and strictly evaluated per sub‚Äësolution.

Datasets live under `RIMO/` and runnable scripts live under `code/`.

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Windows users: run commands in Command Prompt (cmd) from the repo root, e.g. `D:\RIMO`.

Install only what you need:

```bash
pip install pandas openai transformers torch google-genai
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> For local/Transformer models, a GPU with sufficient VRAM is strongly recommended.
> For API usage, set provider keys as environment variables (see below). RIMO‚ÄëP examples use an OpenAI‚Äëcompatible endpoint from Aliyun DashScope (Bailian). See the Bailian console: [Aliyun Bailian (DashScope) console](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/).

## üî• RIMO‚ÄëN: Numeric final‚Äëanswer evaluation

Two options are provided: API or local model.

### API (`code/RIMO_N_API.py`)

- Reads `RIMO/RIMO-N.csv` (columns: `problem_id, problem, answer`).
- Calls an OpenAI‚Äëcompatible chat completions API and extracts the final value inside `\boxed{}`.
- Appends results to `code/answer_qwq.csv` (resumable by `problem_id`).

Run:

```bash
python code\RIMO_N_API.py
```

Configure inside the script: `api_key`, `base_url`, `MODEL_NAME`, `CSV_OUT`.

### Local (`code/RIMO_N_Open_Source.py`)

- Loads a local Hugging Face model (default `Qwen/Qwen3-8B`).
- Writes `code/proof_answer_qwen3_8b.csv` with columns `problem_id, correct_answer, llm_answer`.

Run:

```bash
python code\RIMO_N_Open_Source.py
```

## üî• RIMO‚ÄëP: Sub‚Äëproblem solving and strict evaluation

RIMO‚ÄëP is performed in two phases: (1) produce per‚Äëpart solutions, (2) evaluate them strictly in order.

### What RIMO‚ÄëP measures (from the paper)

- A proof problem is split into up to 4 ordered sub‚Äëproblems. A model must solve them sequentially.
- Let `parts ‚àà {1..4}` be the total sub‚Äëproblems for a given item. Let `S_i` be the number of consecutive correct sub‚Äësolutions starting from part 1.
- The per‚Äëproblem score is `score_i = S_i / parts`. The benchmark performance `P` is the mean of `score_i` over all problems.
- Evaluation is strict: the judge checks only the current step‚Äôs sub‚Äësolution; any error, gap, or unjustified claim causes failure at that step and halts further credit for that problem.

### Phase 1 ‚Äî Produce sub‚Äësolutions (sequential)

Key idea: solve one sub‚Äëproblem at a time and pass the previous solution forward as a proved statement.

Inputs: `RIMO/RIMO-P.csv` with columns:
- `problem_id`, `problem`, `number_of_parts` (1..4)
- `sub-problem1..4`, `sub-solution1..4` (official)

Output format (both API and local solvers):
- CSV columns `problem_id, parts, sub-problem1..4, llm_solution1..4`.
- Non‚Äëexisting parts are kept as `None` (sub‚Äëproblem) and `N/A` (solution).

Environment for API (DashScope/Bailian):

```bash
set DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=YOUR_DASHSCOPE_KEY
```

API solver (uses Qwen3 via DashScope; thinking disabled):

```bash
python code\RIMO_P_solve_subproblems_api.py RIMO\RIMO-P.csv RIMO\RIMO-P_solutions_qwen3_sequential.csv qwen3-8b 0.25
```

Local solver (Transformers):

```bash
python code\RIMO_P_solve_subproblems_local.py RIMO\RIMO-P.csv RIMO\RIMO-P_solutions_local_sequential.csv mistralai/Mathstral-7B-v0.1 0.25 1024
```

Notes:
- Both solvers include a post‚Äëprocessing step that fixes `problem_id` placeholders like `row_00001` by re‚Äëreading the original input (handles BOM‚Äëprefixed headers such as `\ufeffproblem_id`).

### Phase 2 ‚Äî Strict evaluation with DeepSeek‚ÄëR1

Evaluator: `code/RIMO_P_evaluate_solutions_deepseek_r1.py`.

- Loads references from `RIMO/RIMO-P.csv` and candidates from your produced solutions CSV.
- Queries `deepseek-r1` via an OpenAI‚Äëcompatible client (DashScope/Bailian).
- Sequential grading: stops at first incorrect step. Computes per‚Äëproblem `S_i / parts` and overall performance `P`.

Run:

```bash
set DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=YOUR_DASHSCOPE_KEY
python code\RIMO_P_evaluate_solutions_deepseek_r1.py RIMO\RIMO-P.csv RIMO\RIMO-P_solutions_qwen3_sequential.csv deepseek-r1 0.25
```

Outputs a judged CSV next to your solutions file:
- Columns: `problem_id, parts, S_i, score_i, verdict1..4, reason1..4`.
- Prints overall `P` across all evaluated problems.

### Recommended usage protocol (from the paper)

- Do not send all sub‚Äëproblems at once to a model. Solve exactly one sub‚Äëproblem per inference and chain the previous answer forward as an already‚Äëproved statement.
- The evaluator grades strictly step‚Äëby‚Äëstep and stops at the first error, which encourages precise, incremental reasoning.

## üß© Quickstart (API path)

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas openai transformers torch
```

2. Set DashScope (Bailian) key:
```bash
set DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=YOUR_DASHSCOPE_KEY
```

3. Solve RIMO‚ÄëP sequentially:
```bash
python code\RIMO_P_solve_subproblems_api.py RIMO\RIMO-P.csv RIMO\RIMO-P_solutions_qwen3_sequential.csv qwen3-8b 0.25
```

4. Evaluate strictly with DeepSeek‚ÄëR1:
```bash
python code\RIMO_P_evaluate_solutions_deepseek_r1.py RIMO\RIMO-P.csv RIMO\RIMO-P_solutions_qwen3_sequential.csv deepseek-r1 0.25
```

---

## ü§î Troubleshooting

- If you see ‚ÄúNo problems evaluated (no references matched)‚Äù, your CSV may contain a BOM. The evaluator and solvers resolve keys like `problem_id` even when stored as `\ufeffproblem_id`.
- If API calls fail, check `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` and connectivity to the OpenAI‚Äëcompatible endpoint (Bailian DashScope). See [Aliyun Bailian (DashScope) console](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/).
- For local models, reduce model size or `max_new_tokens` if you run out of memory.
