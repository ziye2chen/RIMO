1961p4,"In the interior of triangle $P_1P_2P_3$ a point $P$ is given. Let $Q_1,Q_2,Q_3$ be the intersections of $PP_1, PP_2,PP_3$ with the opposing edges of triangle $P_1P_2P_3$. Prove that among the ratios $\frac{PP_1}{PQ_1},\frac{PP_2}{PQ_2},\frac{PP_3}{PQ_3}$ there exists one not larger than $2$ and one not smaller than $2$.
","Let $K_1=[P_2PP_3], K_2=[P_3PP_1],$ and $K_3=[P_1PP_2].$ Note that by same base in triangles $P_2PP_3$ and $P_2P_1P_3,$ \[\frac{P_1P}{PQ_1}+1=\frac{P_1Q_1}{PQ_1}=\frac{[P_2P_1P_3]}{[P_2PP_3]}=\frac{K_1+K_2+K_3}{K_1}.\] Thus, \[\frac{P_1P}{PQ_1}=\frac{K_2+K_3}{K_1}\]\[\frac{P_2P}{PQ_2}=\frac{K_1+K_3}{K_2}\]\[\frac{P_3P}{PQ_3}=\frac{K_1+K_2}{K_3}.\] Without loss of generality, assume $K_1\leq K_2\leq K_3.$ Hence, \[\frac{P_1P}{PQ_1}=\frac{K_2+K_3}{K_1}\geq \frac{K_1+K_1}{K_1}=2\] and \[\frac{P_3P}{PQ_3}=\frac{K_1+K_2}{K+3}\leq \frac{K_3+K_3}{K_3}=2,\] as desired.",34,1
1960p3,"In a given right triangle $ABC$, the hypotenuse $BC$, of length $a$, is divided into $n$ equal parts ($n$ an odd integer). Let $\alpha$ be the acute angle subtending, from $A$, that segment which contains the midpoint of the hypotenuse. Let $h$ be the length of the altitude to the hypotenuse of the triangle. Prove that:

$\tan{\alpha}=\frac{4nh}{(n^2-1)a}.$","Let $D$ and $E$ be points on $BC$ such that $\alpha=\angle DAE$, $D$ is closer to $B$ than to $C$, and $E$ is closer to $C$ than $B$. Furthermore, let $\alpha_1=\angle BAD$ and $\alpha_2=\angle CAE$, and let $\beta=\angle B$ and $\gamma=\angle C$. Applying Law of Sines on $\triangle BAD$ yields

Similarly, $\tan\alpha_2=\frac{c(n-1)}{b(n+1)}$. Next, we use the sum of tangents formula:

Since $\alpha+\alpha_1+\alpha_2=90^\circ$, we need to find $\tan\alpha=\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-(\alpha_1+\alpha_2)\right)$. This is equal to $\cot(\alpha_1+\alpha_2)$, which is the reciprocal of $\tan(\alpha_1+\alpha_2)$, or $\frac{4nbc}{(b^2+c^2)(n^2-1)}$. Since $bc=ah$ due to triangle areas and $a^2=b^2+c^2$ due to the Pythagorean Theorem, we conclude that the expression is equal to $\frac{4nah}{a^2(n^2-1)}$, which simplifies to $\frac{4nh}{(n^2-1)a}$.",106,2
