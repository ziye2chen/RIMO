Show that if $a_{n+1} - a_n = 1$ for some $n \ge 1$, then $a_{n+2} - a_{n+1} \ge 2$.","We have the identity $a_{k+1}^2 = (\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} x_i)(\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} \frac{1}{x_i}) = a_k^2 + 1 + (\sum_{i=1}^k x_i)\frac{1}{x_{k+1}} + x_{k+1}(\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{1}{x_i})$. By AM-GM inequality, $(\sum_{i=1}^k x_i)\frac{1}{x_{k+1}} + x_{k+1}(\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{1}{x_i}) \ge 2\sqrt{(\sum x_i)(\sum \frac{1}{x_i})} = 2a_k$. Thus, $a_{k+1}^2 \ge a_k^2 + 2a_k + 1 = (a_k+1)^2$, which implies $a_{k+1} \ge a_k+1$. The condition $a_{k+1} - a_k = 1$ is equivalent to the equality case of the AM-GM, which is $(\sum_{i=1}^k x_i)\frac{1}{x_{k+1}} = x_{k+1}(\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{1}{x_i})$. Assume for contradiction that $a_{n+1}-a_n=1$ and $a_{n+2}-a_{n+1}=1$. This means the equality condition holds for both $k=n$ and $k=n+1$. This leads to the equations $\frac{1}{x_{n+1}}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = x_{n+1}\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{x_i}$ and $\frac{1}{x_{n+2}}\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} x_i = x_{n+2}\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} \frac{1}{x_i}$. Manipulating these two equations leads to $\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{x_i} = -\frac{1}{x_{n+1}}$, a contradiction since all $x_i$ are positive. Thus, two consecutive increments of 1 are not possible.

From the previous sub-problem, we know that if $\Delta_n=1$, then $\Delta_{n+1} \ge 2$. We have $a_{2023} = a_1 + \sum_{n=1}^{2022} \Delta_n = 1 + \sum_{n=1}^{2022} \Delta_n$. We can group the 2022 differences into 1011 pairs: $(\Delta_{2k-1} + \Delta_{2k})$ for $k=1, \ldots, 1011$. For each pair, if $\Delta_{2k-1} = 1$, then $\Delta_{2k} \ge 2$, so their sum is at least 3. If $\Delta_{2k-1} \ge 2$, then since $\Delta_{2k} \ge 1$, their sum is also at least 3. In all cases, $\Delta_{2k-1} + \Delta_{2k} \ge 3$. Thus, the total sum of the differences is $\sum_{n=1}^{2022} \Delta_n = \sum_{k=1}^{1011} (\Delta_{2k-1} + \Delta_{2k}) \ge \sum_{k=1}^{1011} 3 = 1011 \times 3 = 3033$.

It is given that $\angle CPD = \angle ADB$. Since points $A, B, D, M$ lie on a circle, $\angle ADB = \angle AMB = \angle XMY$. Thus, $\angle YPX = \angle XMY$.

Claim. $A_{1}$ is the circumcentre of $A_{2} B C$ and cyclic variations.\\
Proof. Since $A_{1}$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $B C$ and inside $\triangle B A_{2} C$, it suffices to prove $\angle B A_{1} C=2 \angle B A_{2} C$. This follows from

$$
\begin{aligned}

and so $B_{1} C_{1} B_{2} C_{2}$ is cyclic. Likewise $C_{1} A_{1} C_{2} A_{2}$ and $A_{1} B_{1} A_{2} B_{2}$ are cyclic. Note that hexagon $A_{1} B_{2} C_{1} A_{2} B_{1} C_{2}$ is not cyclic since

Similarly $\Varangle C B_{3} B=90^{\circ}+\Varangle B_{1} B_{2} C_{1}$. Hence, using $B_{1} C_{1} B_{2} C_{2}$ cyclic

\Varangle B B_{3} C=90^{\circ}+\Varangle C_{1} B_{2} B_{1}=90^{\circ}+\Varangle C_{1} C_{2} B_{1}=\Varangle B C_{3} C

Similarly $C A C_{3} A_{3}$ and $A B A_{3} B_{3}$ are cyclic. $A C_{3} B A_{3} C B_{3}$ is not cyclic because then $A B_{2} C B_{3}$ cyclic would mean $B_{2}$ lies on $\odot A B C$ which is impossible since $B_{2}$ lies inside $\triangle A B C$. Thus we can apply radical axis theorem to the three circles to get $A A_{3}, B B_{3}, C C_{3}$ concur at a point $Y$ which has equal power with respect to $\delta_{A}, \delta_{B}, \delta_{C}$.

We now make some technical observations before finishing.

  \item Let $O$ be the centre of $\triangle A B C$. We have that
\end{itemize}

$$
\angle B A_{1} C=480^{\circ}-\angle C B_{1} A-\angle A C_{1} B>480^{\circ}-180^{\circ}-180^{\circ}=120^{\circ} .
$$

so $A_{1}$ lies inside $\triangle B O C$. We have similar results for $B_{1}, C_{1}$ and thus $\triangle B A_{1} C, \triangle C B_{1} A$, $\triangle A C_{1} B$ have disjoint interiors. It follows that $A_{1} B_{2} C_{1} A_{2} B_{1} C_{2}$ is a convex hexagon thus $X$ lies on segment $A_{1} A_{2}$ and therefore is inside $\delta_{A}$.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Since $A_{1}$ is the centre of $A_{2} B C$ we have that $A_{1} A_{2}=A_{1} A_{3}$ so, from cyclic quadrilateral $A A_{2} A_{1} A_{3}$ we get that lines $A A_{2}$ and $A A_{3} \equiv A Y$ are reflections in line $A A_{1}$. As $X$ lies on segment $A_{1} A_{2}$, the only way $X \equiv Y$ is if $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ both lie on the perpendicular bisector of $B C$. But this forces $B_{1}$ and $C_{1}$ to also be reflections in this line meaning $A_{1} B_{1}=A_{1} C_{1}$ contradicting the scalene condition.
\end{itemize}

Summarising, we have distinct points $X, Y$ with equal power with respect to $\delta_{A}, \delta_{B}, \delta_{C}$ thus these circles have a common radical axis. As $X$ lies inside $\delta_{A}$ (and similarly $\delta_{B}, \delta_{C}$ ), this radical axis intersects the circles at two points and so $\delta_{A}, \delta_{B}, \delta_{C}$ have two points in common.",,,,,,

The exponent of $9=3^2$ in $n!$ depends on the number of pairs of factor 3. Thus, $E_9(n) = \lfloor v_3(n!)/2 \rfloor$. For $n=p^k$, the sum in Legendre's formula is a geometric series: $v_p((p^k)!) = \sum_{i=1}^k \lfloor p^k/p^i \rfloor = \sum_{i=1}^k p^{k-i} = \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} p^j = \frac{p^k-1}{p-1} = \frac{n-1}{p-1}$.",For positive integers $n$ and $k \geqslant 2$ define $E_{k}(n)$ as the greatest exponent $r$ such that $k^{r}$ divides $n!$.

1. To show $E_{10}(n)>E_{9}(n)$ for infinitely many $n$, consider the family $n=5^{2l-1}$ for $l \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. For these $n$, $E_{10}(n) = v_5(n!) = \frac{n-1}{5-1}=\frac{n-1}{4}$. Since $n = 5^{2l-1} \equiv 2 \pmod 3$, $v_3(n!) = \sum \lfloor n/3^i \rfloor < \frac{n-2}{3}+\frac{n}{9}+\frac{n}{27}+\dots = \frac{n}{2}-\frac{2}{3}$. So, $E_9(n) = \lfloor v_3(n!)/2 \rfloor < \frac{1}{2}(\frac{n}{2}-\frac{2}{3}) = \frac{n}{4}-\frac{1}{3}$. Thus, $E_{10}(n)=\frac{n-1}{4} > \frac{n}{4}-\frac{1}{3} > E_9(n)$ for this infinite family. 
2. To show $E_{10}(m)<E_{9}(m)$ for infinitely many $m$, consider the family $m=3^{4l-2}$ for $l \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. For these $m$, $v_3(m!) = \frac{m-1}{3-1}=\frac{m-1}{2}$. Since $m=9^{2l-1} \equiv 1 \pmod 4$, $E_9(m) = \lfloor \frac{v_3(m!)}{2} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{m-1}{4} \rfloor = \frac{m-1}{4}$. As $m=9^{2l-1} \equiv 4 \pmod 5$, $E_{10}(m) = v_5(m!) < \frac{m-4}{5}+\frac{m}{25}+\dots = \frac{m}{4}-\frac{4}{5}$. Thus, $E_{10}(m) < \frac{m}{4}-\frac{4}{5} < \frac{m-1}{4} = E_9(m)$ for this infinite family. This completes the proof.",,,,

Since $D,X,Y$ are collinear, $\angle DXZ + \angle ZXY = 180^\circ$, so $\angle DXZ + \angle ZCD = 180^\circ$, which implies $C,D,X,Z$ is a cyclic quadrilateral. Since both $Z$ and $Z'$ lie on the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$ and on the circle through $C,D,X$, they must coincide. Therefore $Z=Z'$, which implies $AZ \parallel BC$.","Let $A B C$ be an acute-angled triangle with $A C>A B$, let $O$ be its circumcentre, and let $D$ be a point on the segment $B C$. The line through $D$ perpendicular to $B C$ intersects the lines $A O, A C$ and $A B$ at $W, X$ and $Y$, respectively. The circumcircles of triangles $A X Y$ and $A B C$ intersect again at $Z \neq A$. Prove that if $O W=O D$, then $D Z$ is tangent to the circle $A X Y$.","From the first sub-problem, the condition $OW=OD$ implies that $AZ \parallel BC$. To prove that $DZ$ is tangent to the circumcircle of $\triangle AXY$ at $Z$, we use the converse of the Alternate Segment Theorem. We aim to show that the angle between the line $DZ$ and the chord $AZ$ is equal to the angle subtended by the chord in the alternate segment, which is $\angle AYZ$. As $AZ \parallel BC$ and $D$ lies on the line $BC$, we have $\angle AZD = \angle CDZ$ because they are alternate interior angles. As established in the previous sub-problem, the quadrilateral $CDXZ$ is cyclic. This implies $\angle CDZ = \angle CXZ$, as they subtend the same arc $CZ$. The points $A,X,Y,Z$ are also concyclic, so $\angle AXZ = \angle AYZ$. Since $X$ lies on the line segment $AC$, $\angle CXZ$ is the same angle as $\angle AXZ$. Combining these angle equalities, we get the chain: $\angle AZD = \angle CDZ = \angle CXZ = \angle AYZ$. This shows $\angle AZD = \angle AYZ$, which completes the proof that $DZ$ is tangent to the circle $AXY$.",,,,

Using the cyclic quadrilaterals $BX_2E_2Z_2$ and $CX_2F_2Y_2$, we find $\Varangle(E_1E_2, F_1F_2) = \Varangle(BE_2, CF_2) = \Varangle(Z_2E_2, Z_2X_2) + \Varangle(Y_2X_2, Y_2F_2) = \Varangle(Z_2E_2, Y_2F_2)$. Since $Z_2E_2 \perp AB$ and $Y_2F_2 \perp AC$, this angle equals $\Varangle(AB, AC)$. As $\triangle ABC$ is non-degenerate, this angle is non-zero, so the lines are not parallel.

From the first sub-problem, $\Varangle(HE_i, HF_i) = \Varangle(E_1E_2, F_1F_2) = \Varangle(AB, AC)$. The vertex $D_i$ is the intersection of the line through $Y_i$ perpendicular to $AC$ (line $D_iF_i$) and the line through $Z_i$ perpendicular to $AB$ (line $D_iE_i$). The quadrilateral $AY_iD_iZ_i$ is cyclic as $\angle AY_iD_i = \angle AZ_iD_i = 90^\circ$. Thus, the angle at vertex $D_i$ is $\Varangle(D_iE_i, D_iF_i) = \Varangle(AZ_i, AY_i) = \Varangle(AB, AC)$.

Let us call two positive integers $m, n$ friends if $p(m)+p(n)$ and $q(m)+q(n)$ are both even integers. We start by noting that the pairs $(p(k), q(k))$ modulo 2 can take at most 4 different values; thus, among any five different positive integers there are two which are friends.

In addition, both functions $p$ and $q$ satisfy $f(a b)=f(a)+f(b)$ for any $a, b$. Therefore, if $m$ and $n$ are divisible by $d$, then both $p$ and $q$ satisfy the equality $f(m)+f(n)=f(m / d)+$ $f(n / d)+2 f(d)$. This implies that $m, n$ are friends if and only if $m / d, n / d$ are friends.

Indeed, if we were able to construct such a set, then there would be a pair of integers $\left\{n_{i}, n_{j}\right\}$ which are friends, according to the first observation. Additionally, the second observation yields that the quotients $n_{i} / d_{i j}, n_{j} / d_{i j}$ form a pair of friends, which happen to be consecutive integers, thus giving a special integer as desired.

Any special number can be contained in at most ten sets $S_{k}$, from where we conclude that the number of special integers in $[1,100 k]$ is at least $k / 10$.

Finally, let $N=100 k+r$, with $k \geqslant 1$ and $0 \leqslant r<100$, so that we have $N<100(k+1) \leqslant$ $200 k$. Then the number of special integers in $[1, N]$ is at least $k / 10>N / 2000$, as we wanted to prove.

Comment 1. The statement is also true for $N \geqslant 15$ as at least one of the numbers $7,14,15$ is special.\\
Comment 2. Another approach would be to note that if $p(2 n), p(2 n+1), p(2 n+2)$ all have the same parity then one of the numbers $n, 2 n, 2 n+1$ is special. Indeed, if $q(n)+q(n+1)$ is even then $n$ is special since $p(n)+p(n+1) \equiv p(2 n)+p(2 n+2) \equiv 0(\bmod 2)$. Otherwise, if $q(n)+q(n+1)$ is odd, so is $q(2 n)+q(2 n+2)$ which implies that exactly one of the numbers $2 n, 2 n+1$ is special.

Unfortunately, it seems hard to show that the set of such $n$ has positive density: see a recent paper \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01545}{https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01545} for the proof that all eight patterns of the parities of $p(n), p(n+1), p(n+2)$ appear for a positive proportion of positive integers.",,,,,,

2021c3,"A thimblerigger has 2021 thimbles numbered from 1 through 2021. The thimbles are arranged in a circle in arbitrary order. The thimblerigger performs a sequence of 2021 moves; in the $k^{\text {th }}$ move, he swaps the positions of the two thimbles adjacent to thimble $k$.

Show that each of the 2021 positions is the central position (i.e., holds the thimble k) for exactly one move k.","Define a thimble t as ""white"" before move t and ""black"" from move t onwards. The assumption implies that in move k, the thimbles adjacent to thimble k are of the same color (both black or both white). Color each position by the color of the thimble it contains. In move k, thimble k is white. Its neighbors are swapped. Then, thimble k becomes black. The swap operation exchanges two thimbles of the same color, so the colors of the neighboring positions do not change. The only position that changes color is the one holding thimble k, which turns from white to black. As there are 2021 moves and 2021 positions, and each move turns exactly one position from white to black permanently, each position must be the central position for exactly one move.","Under the same assumption, show that for any position P, if it is the central position for move k, then before move k, P always contains a thimble with a number greater than the current move's number, and after move k, it always contains a thimble with a number less than the current move's number.","From sub-problem 1, each position P is the central position for exactly one move k. For any move m < k, P has not yet been a central position. Following the coloring argument from the previous step, P is a ""white"" position, meaning it holds a white thimble. The thimble m is at the central position for move m (which is not P), so the thimble t at P is not m. Since t is a white thimble at move m, its number satisfies t 鈮?m. As t 鈮?m, we have t > m. For any move m > k, P has already been a central position and is now a ""black"" position, meaning it holds a black thimble t. This means t < m.","Under the same assumption, define a coloring on the positions: a position is ""green"" if, when it was central for move k, the swapped thimbles a,b satisfied a,b > k, and ""red"" if a,b < k. Show that any two adjacent positions must have different colors.","Let P1 and P2 be adjacent positions. From sub-problem 1, they are central for unique moves k1 and k2. Assume k1 < k2. At move k1, thimble k1 is at P1, and P2 is an adjacent position. By sub-problem 2, since k1 < k2, position P2 contains a thimble t > k1. This thimble t is swapped in move k1. By the main assumption, the other swapped thimble must also have a number greater than k1. Thus, P1 is colored green. At move k2, thimble k2 is at P2, and P1 is an adjacent position. By sub-problem 2, since k1 < k2, P1 now contains a thimble t' < k2. This thimble t' is swapped in move k2. By assumption, the other swapped thimble must also be less than k2. Thus, P2 is colored red. Therefore, adjacent positions have different colors.","Prove that there exists a value of k such that, in the k^{\text {th }} move, the thimblerigger swaps some thimbles a and b such that a<k<b.","Assume for contradiction that for every move k, the swapped thimbles a, b satisfy either a, b < k or a, b > k. From sub-problem 3, this assumption implies that any two adjacent positions in the circular arrangement of 2021 thimbles must have different colors (one red, one green). This requires the colors of the positions to alternate around the circle. An alternating 2-coloring is only possible for a cycle of even length. Since there are 2021 positions, which is an odd number, this is a contradiction. Therefore, the initial assumption is false, which proves the statement."

The number of paths is unchanged. If only one of the edges is used, say in a path $P_1$, we replace $P_1$ with $P_C$. If neither edge is used, we add $P_C$.

Define a new sequence $b_i = a_i + a_{i-k-1} - 1$ for all integers $i$ (with indices taken modulo $2n+1$).

Finally, we prove that $P K \| B C$. Indeed, using the circles $\tau$ and $\gamma$ we conclude that

Comment 1. There are several variations of the above solution.\\
E.g., after finding circles $\alpha$ and $\gamma$, one can notice that there exists a homothety $h$ mapping the triangle $T P Q$ to the triangle $D C A$; the centre of that homothety is $Y=A C \cap T D$. Since

$$
\angle D P E=\angle D A E=\angle D C B=\angle D Q T
$$

the quadrilateral $T P D Q$ is inscribed in some circle $\tau$. We have $h(\tau)=\Omega$, so the point $D^{*}=h(D)$ lies on $\Omega$.

Finally, by

$$
\angle D C D^{*}=\angle T P D=\angle B A D
$$

the points $B$ and $D^{*}$ are symmetric with respect to the diameter of $\Omega$ passing through $D$. This yields $D B=D D^{*}$ and $B D^{*} \| E F$, so $h(K)=B$, and $B K$ passes through $Y$.

The power of $L_D$ with respect to $\Omega$ is $L_D D^2$. The power of $L_D$ with respect to $\gamma_B$ is $L_D D_1^2$, since $\gamma_B$ is tangent to $AC$ at $D_1$. By an angle chase, $\angle L_D D D_1 = \angle L_D D C + \angle C D D_1 = \angle DAC + \angle AD D_1 = \angle D D_1 A$, so triangle $L_D D D_1$ is isosceles with $L_D D = L_D D_1$. Thus, $L_D$ has equal power with respect to both circles and lies on their radical axis, $BT_B$. So the line $BT_B$ is $BL_D$. Similarly, triangle $L_B B B_1$ is isosceles with $L_B B = L_B B_1$, so $L_B$ lies on the radical axis $DT_D$ of $\Omega$ and $\gamma_D$. Thus, the line $DT_D$ is $DL_B$.","Let $H = AC \cap BD$.

Collinearity is given since they lie on $AC$.

Since $\angle BHL_B = \angle DHL_D$ and $\sin\angle HBL_B = \sin\angle HDL_D$ (angles between a chord and tangents at its endpoints are supplementary), we get $\frac{HL_B}{HL_D} = \frac{B_1 L_B}{D_1 L_D} = \frac{HL_B - B_1 L_B}{HL_D - D_1 L_D} = \frac{HB_1}{HD_1}$.

A homothety maps a line to a parallel line. Therefore, $h$ maps the line passing through $B$ and $L_D$ to the line passing through their images, $D$ and $L_B$.

This inversion maps the circumcircle of 螖MBD to the circumcircle of 螖ADC. Since D is on the circle of inversion, it is a fixed point. The other intersection point of the two circles, K, must also be a fixed point of the inversion, so TK = TD. This implies T lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment KD. The point $O_1$, as the circumcenter of 螖ADC which contains D and K, also lies on this bisector. From Sub-problem 3, D, K, E, X are concyclic, so the circle (DXE) is the same as (DXKE).

This contradicts the assumption that $i_s, i_{s+1}$ are consecutive indices in $I_d$. Thus, $i_{s+1}-i_s$ must be odd. Now consider three consecutive indices $i_s, i_{s+1}, i_{s+2}$. The difference $i_{s+2}-i_s$ is even. Let $m'=(i_{s+2}-i_s)/2$. Then $a_{i_s+2m'} | (a_{i_s} + a_{i_s+m'})$, which is $a_{i_{s+2}} | (a_{i_s} + a_{(i_s+i_{s+2})/2})$.

so it suffices to prove that $(a+2 b+3 c+4 d)\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}\right)<1=(a+b+c+d)^{3}$. This can be done in various ways, for example:

$$
\begin{aligned}
(a+b+c+d)^{3}> & a^{2}(a+3 b+3 c+3 d)+b^{2}(3 a+b+3 c+3 d) \\
& \quad+c^{2}(3 a+3 b+c+3 d)+d^{2}(3 a+3 b+3 c+d) \\
\geqslant & \left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}\right) \cdot(a+2 b+3 c+4 d)
\end{aligned}

Let $p_j = |M_j|$. Prove that for each $j$, $\sum_{i \in M_{j}} \frac{a_{i}}{\sqrt{a_{1}^{2}+\ldots+a_{i}^{2}}} \leqslant 4 \sqrt{p_{j}}$.","Let $p_j = |M_j|$. For any $\ell \in M_j$, $a_\ell \le 2^j$. If we are considering the $i$-th term in the sum over $M_j$ (when the indices are sorted), its denominator $\sqrt{a_1^2 + \dots + a_\ell^2}$ contains at least $i$ terms from $M_j$, each with value at least $2^{j-1}$. Thus, the sum is bounded: $\sum_{\ell \in M_{j}} \frac{a_{\ell}}{\sqrt{a_{1}^{2}+\ldots+a_{\ell}^{2}}} \leqslant \sum_{i=1}^{p_{j}} \frac{2^{j}}{\sqrt{i \cdot (2^{j-1})^2}} = 2 \sum_{i=1}^{p_{j}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{i}}$. Using the inequality $\frac{1}{\sqrt{i}} \le 2(\sqrt{i}-\sqrt{i-1})$, the sum is further bounded by $2 \sum_{i=1}^{p_{j}} 2(\sqrt{i}-\sqrt{i-1}) = 4(\sqrt{p_j} - \sqrt{0}) = 4 \sqrt{p_{j}}$.","Let $n$ and $k$ be positive integers. Prove that for $a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n} \in\left[1,2^{k}\right]$ one has $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{a_{i}}{\sqrt{a_{1}^{2}+\ldots+a_{i}^{2}}} \leqslant 4 \sqrt{k n}$.","Partition the indices $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ into $k$ sets $M_j$ where $i \in M_j$ if $a_i \in [2^{j-1}, 2^j]$. The total sum can be split over these partitions: $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{a_{i}}{\sqrt{a_{1}^{2}+\ldots+a_{i}^{2}}} = \sum_{j=1}^{k} \sum_{i \in M_j} \frac{a_{i}}{\sqrt{a_{1}^{2}+\ldots+a_{i}^{2}}}$. Using the result from the previous sub-problem, this is $\leqslant \sum_{j=1}^{k} 4\sqrt{|M_j|} = 4\sum_{j=1}^{k} \sqrt{|M_j|}$. By the QM-AM inequality, $\sum_{j=1}^{k} \sqrt{|M_j|} \le \sqrt{k \sum_{j=1}^{k} |M_j|}$. Since $\sum_{j=1}^{k} |M_j| = n$, the expression is bounded by $4\sqrt{kn}$.",,,,
